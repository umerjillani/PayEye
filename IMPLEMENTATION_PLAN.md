# Multi-Tenant Implementation Plan

## Current Status
The user has requested a multi-tenant SaaS architecture where:
- Organizations purchase the software
- Super admin (user) manages organizations and grants access
- Organization admins manage payroll within their organization
- Separate login systems for super admin vs organization admins
- Complete data isolation between organizations

## Practical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Super Admin Portal (Priority 1)
1. Create `/super-admin` route for super admin access
2. Simple super admin table and authentication
3. Organization management interface for super admin
4. Organization creation and basic management

### Phase 2: Organization Isolation (Priority 2)  
1. Add `organizationId` field to existing tables
2. Update existing routes to filter by organizationId
3. Ensure all data operations include organization scope
4. Update storage layer for organization filtering

### Phase 3: Organization Admin System (Priority 3)
1. Organization admin invitation system
2. Organization-specific login with subdomain support
3. Role-based permissions within organizations
4. Organization admin management interface

### Phase 4: UI Updates (Priority 4)
1. Super admin dashboard and organization management UI
2. Organization selector for multi-org admins
3. Organization branding and customization
4. User invitation and management interfaces

## Technical Approach
- **Minimal Breaking Changes**: Add organizationId gradually
- **Backward Compatibility**: Keep existing functionality working
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add multi-tenant features step by step
- **Data Safety**: Ensure no data loss during migration

## Next Steps
1. Start with super admin portal - separate login system
2. Add organization management interface
3. Gradually add organizationId to tables
4. Update authentication and authorization

This approach ensures the user gets the multi-tenant architecture they need while maintaining the existing payroll functionality.
