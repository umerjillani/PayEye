# Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture Implementation Plan

## User Requirements Summary
1. **Organizations** purchase the software from us
2. **Super Admin** (you) manages organizations and gives access to organization admins
3. **Super Admin login** is separate and inaccessible to organization admins
4. **Organization Admins** use the payroll functionality within their organization
5. **Data isolation** between organizations
6. **Role-based permissions** within organizations

## Architecture Hierarchy
```
Super Admin (Software Creator)
├── Organization 1 (Customer)
│   ├── Organization Admin (Customer Admin)
│   ├── Companies
│   ├── Agencies
│   └── Employees
├── Organization 2 (Customer)
│   ├── Organization Admin (Customer Admin)
│   ├── Companies
│   ├── Agencies
│   └── Employees
└── ...
```

## Database Schema Changes Required
1. **Super Admins Table** - Separate from regular users
2. **Organizations Table** - Customer companies that buy the software
3. **Organization Admins Table** - Customer admins within each organization
4. **Add organizationId** to all existing tables for data isolation

## Authentication System
1. **Super Admin Portal** - Completely separate login at `/super-admin`
2. **Organization Portal** - Regular login at `/` with subdomain routing
3. **Session isolation** between super admin and organization admin systems
4. **Permission-based access control** within organizations

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new database schema with multi-tenant structure
2. Implement dual authentication system
3. Add organization creation and management for super admins
4. Update existing routes to include organizationId filtering
5. Create organization admin invitation system
6. Update frontend to support multi-tenant UI

## Data Flow
1. Super Admin creates Organization
2. Super Admin invites Organization Admin
3. Organization Admin logs in to their organization's portal
4. Organization Admin manages their agencies, employees, payroll within their organization scope
5. All data is automatically filtered by organizationId

This architecture ensures complete data isolation between customers while maintaining the existing payroll functionality within each organization.
