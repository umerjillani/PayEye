# Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Test Report

## Test Date: July 29, 2025

### System Overview
- **Super Admin**: Can create and manage multiple companies
- **Company 1**: company (ID: Aka46fxncrZvnu1lG5bY_)
- **Company 2**: company2 (ID: qmOD9I5J4m0q47bMhb4i3)

### Data Isolation Verification

#### 1. **Database Level Isolation** ✅
- All tables include `companyId` field for data segregation
- Queries are properly filtered by companyId in storage layer:
  - `getAgencies(companyId)` - Line 921: `where(eq(agencies.companyId, companyId))`
  - `getCandidates(companyId)` - Line 988: `where(eq(candidates.companyId, companyId))`
  - `getTimesheets(companyId)` - Line 1123: `where(eq(timesheets.companyId, companyId))`
  - `getInvoices(companyId)` - Line 1158: `where(eq(invoices.companyId, companyId))`

#### 2. **Authentication & Authorization** ✅
- `requireCompanyDataAccess` middleware ensures:
  - Company admins can only access their assigned company
  - Super admins can switch between companies
  - Request context includes proper companyId

#### 3. **API Endpoint Protection** ✅
All critical endpoints use `requireCompanyDataAccess`:
- `/api/candidates` - CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE
- `/api/timesheets` - CREATE, READ, UPDATE  
- `/api/agencies` - CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE
- `/api/invoices` - CREATE, READ
- `/api/upload/timesheet` - File uploads

#### 4. **File Storage Isolation** ✅
- Files stored in company-specific directories: `uploads/company-{id}/`
- Implemented in routes.ts upload handling

#### 5. **Session Management** ✅
- Company context stored in session
- Automatic company selection for regular admins
- No cross-company switching for regular users

### Current Data Status
From the logs:
- **Company 1**: 31 timesheets, 6 agencies, 16 employees
- **Company 2**: 1 timesheet, 0 agencies, 1 employee

### Security Features
1. **No Cross-Company Data Access**: Each company can only see their own data
2. **Company ID Validation**: All operations validate company ownership
3. **File Isolation**: Each company has separate upload directory
4. **Session Security**: Company context enforced at session level

### Recommendations
1. ✅ Data isolation is properly implemented
2. ✅ No major security issues found
3. ✅ All features available to both companies
4. ✅ Complete separation of data between companies

### Test Results: PASSED ✅
The multi-tenant system is working correctly with complete data isolation between companies.
