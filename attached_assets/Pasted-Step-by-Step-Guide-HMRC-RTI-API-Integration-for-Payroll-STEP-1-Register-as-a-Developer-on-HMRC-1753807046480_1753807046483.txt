Step-by-Step Guide: HMRC RTI API Integration for Payroll

🧱 STEP 1: Register as a Developer on HMRC
👉 Do this at:

https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk

Create a developer account
Register your application
Subscribe to the following APIs:
Real Time Information (RTI)
Employer Payment Summary (EPS)
NINO Verification (optional)
Obtain:
Client ID
Client Secret
Redirect URI
🔐 STEP 2: Implement OAuth 2.0 Authentication
HMRC requires OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Code Grant) flow for authentication.

🔄 OAuth Flow Summary:

Redirect user (employer) to HMRC auth page:
https://test-accounts.service.hmrc.gov.uk/oauth/authorize
With:

client_id
response_type=code
redirect_uri
scope=read:employment-history write:real-time-information
User logs in with Government Gateway credentials
Redirect returns ?code=abc123
Exchange code for access token via:
POST https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/oauth/token
With:

grant_type=authorization_code
client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, code
📤 STEP 3: Build FPS (Full Payment Submission) Request
After payroll is calculated:

✅ Submit the FPS:

POST https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/individuals/employments/payments
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/vnd.hmrc.1.0+json
📄 Example Payload (simplified):

{
  "employerRef": "123/A4567",
  "employees": [
    {
      "nino": "AB123456C",
      "name": "John Smith",
      "pay": {
        "gross": 2500,
        "tax": 300,
        "ni": 200
      },
      "paymentDate": "2025-07-31"
    }
  ]
}
💡 You must calculate PAYE, NICs, student loans, etc. before submission.

📨 STEP 4: Handle HMRC Response
The response will include:

{
  "submissionId": "abc-123-def",
  "status": "ACCEPTED",
  "acknowledgementReference": "XYZ098"
}
✅ Store this submission ID for auditing.

❌ If error returned (e.g., bad NINO), display it in UI and flag it for correction.

📄 STEP 5: Send EPS (Employer Payment Summary)
This is submitted monthly (or if you're reclaiming SMP, SPP, etc.).

POST https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/individuals/employments/payments/eps
EPS includes:

Recoverable statutory pay
Apprenticeship levy
CIS deductions
📋 STEP 6: Submission Logs / UI Integration
Show status per submission (Accepted, Rejected)
Include:
Date
Employer Ref
Employee count
HMRC status
🔄 STEP 7: HMRC Test vs Live Environments
Environment	Base URL
Test (sandbox)	https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk
Live (production)	https://api.service.hmrc.gov.uk
💡 You must re-authorize and re-obtain tokens for the live environment.
